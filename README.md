# Programming_for_Analytics_Exercises
These were my first exercises when I started learning about programming during my university studies. The course was ‘Programming for Analytics’ and was an introductory course. The exercises done here are the assignments hence, you can find the explanation to almost every line of codes. These exercises have shaped my understanding and experience in working with python codes. 

Through these exercises, I have had the following learnings. 

1.	User Input Handling: Receiving and processing user inputs in Python programs.
2.	Data Formatting: Converting data into human-readable formats (e.g., time formatting).
3.	Conditional Statements: Implementing decision-making based on input criteria using conditions.
4.	Mapping and Data Structures: Associating data and managing it effectively using dictionaries, lists, etc.
5.	Looping and Iteration: Handling repetitive tasks and processing multiple data entries with loops.
6.	Arithmetic Operations: Performing mathematical calculations based on specific rules or conditions.
7.	Dictionary Usage: Utilizing dictionaries to map between related pieces of information.
8.	String Manipulation: Processing and manipulating strings for data extraction or modification.
9.	Nested Data Access: Accessing specific information from nested data structures.
10.	Conditional Logic: Applying multiple conditions for decision-making.
11.	Function Implementation: Creating reusable functions for specific tasks.
12.	List Operations: Accessing elements and performing calculations within lists.
13.	Mathematical Computations: Using arithmetic operations for calculations and conversions.
14.	Data Parsing and Interpretation: Converting data formats efficiently (e.g., Morse code to text, Celsius to Fahrenheit).
15.	Algorithmic Thinking: Implementing algorithms for forecasting or problem-solving.
16.	Random Number Generation: Creating functions for generating specific criteria-based random numbers.
17.	NumPy Operations: Utilizing NumPy for efficient element-wise calculations.
18.	Data Visualization: Using Python libraries for graphical representation of data.
19.	Time Series Plotting: Plotting time-series data to represent variations and highlight key points.
